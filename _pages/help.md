## Local Notifications
### Notification Interval
The notification displays every 15 mins and is disabled when no task is in progress. When Katagrafo is in the foreground, no notification displays. This is an iOS notification behavior.

**The interval is not configurable in the current version.**

### Disabling Notification
You can disable notification from the iOS Settings.
